\section{Testbench}
\label{sec:tests}
The tests that were conducted on the designed hardware module will be described in this section. In particular, 3 tests have been carried out:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given that the key space is small enough\footnote{Actually, the key space is definitely too small to provide any security.}, it is possible to completely test the encryption (or, symmetrically, the decryption) of the module. Hence, a test performs the encryption of every possible character ($2^8$ possible characters) with every possible key ($2^8$ possible values).
    \item The previous test was repeated, but it was added a random number (0 to 5) of idle cycles between the encryption of two values. This test was carried out to check that the signals were properly handled by the module.
    \item Finally, it has been checked that the \cref{thm:enc_inv_dec} actually holds. To do so, a file (of $\sim$39000 characters) has been encrypted, and subsequently it has been checked that its decryption (using the same key) was the same as the original file.
\end{enumerate}
