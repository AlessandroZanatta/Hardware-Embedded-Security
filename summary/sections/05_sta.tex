The usage of the hardware resources of the target FPGA is very low ($< 1\%$). The number of total used pins is as expected.

Regarding the timing analysis, we have reached a frequency of $133.32$MHz at 85°C, and a frequency of $132.89$MHz at 0°C. In both case, the frequency is higher than the predetermined one ($100$MHz).
